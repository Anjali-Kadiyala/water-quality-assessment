# Water Quality Assessment

This is an academic project based on Machine Learning. 
The objective of the project is to analyse a sample of water defined by a set of nine parameters and determine if the sample of water is safe for human consumption.

    
## Data:
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
- A CSV file that contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.
- The dataset needs to be cleaned, processed and split into 2 sets for training and testing respecively.
- There are ten columns in the dataset:
    - `ph`- indicator of acid-base balance of water (0 - 14).
    - `Hardness` - capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
    - `Solids` - total dissolved solids in ppm.
    - `Sulfate` - amount of sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
    - `Conductivity` - electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.
    - `Organic_carbon` - amount of organic carbon in ppm.
    - `Trihalomethanes` - amount of trihalomethanes in μg/L.
    - `Turbidity` - measure of light emitting property of water in NTU.
    - `Potability` - indicates if water is safe for human consumption. `Not potable: 0`, `Potable: 1`
